        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
                Mojisola Salaudeen is a writer and editor who loves food.
                She also loves stories and believes in the ability of stories to 
                shape narratives, inform and connect us. She has in the past three years 
                written for various publications and reached a wide range of audience.
                She has contributed to a lifestyle and youth-centric blog, undergone an 
                editing training and contributed to a literary journal and most recently, 
                she wrote news stories around election and governance in the world. <br><br>
                Mojisola Salaudeen loves food so much that she got a Master’s degree in food microbiology.
                She is interested in food safety and health, and wants to learn more 
                and figure out ways in which we can reduce the burden of foodborne diseases, 
                and ultimately produce safer foods. <br><br>
                When she’s not daydreaming, she’s reading new poetry, writing or editing generally. 
                She believes that the written and spoken word can mend, 
                reclaim and further our collective humanity.<br><br>
                She's currently upskilling by learning a programming language. 
                She's open to job opportunities either in research and development or the creative writing industry.
